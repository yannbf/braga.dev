One of the most important things in the Storybook ecosystem are [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/), installable packages that you can add to your project, that will provide extra functionality to Storybook. There are hundreds of incredible addons that help you do great things, such as connect with design tools, analyze the accessibility of your components, measure performance, automatically generate documentation for your components, and so on.

Addons can be used to add support for features, such as Redux, Routing, etc.

## The addon catalog

Addons are created both by Storybook maintainers but also by the community, and they can be easily found in the official [Storybook's Addon catalog](https://storybook.js.org/addons/). It's insane the amount of addons you can find, and all the cool functionality they can add to your project.
