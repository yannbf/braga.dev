In Storybook 6.4, a whole new set of possibilities were added with the introduction of [interaction testing](blog-link-here). Interaction tests provide you the power of combining browser-compatible versions of [Testing Library](https://testing-library-link-here) and [Jest](https://jest-link-here), provided by Storybook, which run directly in the browser and allow you to write tests very similarly than you do when writing tests for JSDOM.

Before, you were only able to create different variants of your components by passing different props/inputs to it, via args. Cool, that was great for smaller, simpler components. However, as you start adding interactive, perhaps more complex components to Storybook, they might even not receive any props at all.

## The play function

## Why would I do that?

You might be asking:

> "Wait, I already wrote all my tests in node with Jest and Testing Library. Why go through the trouble of moving them to Storybook?"

## Addon interactions

Even though you can write interactions by using the play function alone, you can certain gain tons more value by using [addon-interactions](url-here).

### The addon panel

Addon interactions will display the interactions and assertions that you wrote, directly in the browser, via its panel. This way, you can easily see which stories contain interactions, and which don't.

Apart from that, you will get valuable feedback of any errors or failures of your tests, or your component:

### Step debugger

Additionally, the addon panel provides playback controls, which allows you to go back and forth with all steps you wrote for that story. This gives you the possibility to visualize all states of your component as the interactions happen, and also make it simpler to debug in case of failures:

In Storybook 7.0, this feature is enabled by default. In Storybook 6.4, you have to opt-in to it, by adding the following field in your `.storybook/main.js` file:

```js:.storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
  features: {
    interactionsDebugger: true
  }
}
```

## ESLint is your friend

Storybook provides an ESLint plugin called `eslint-plugin-storybook`, which was created to guide you in all things Storybook, to prevent you from committing common mistakes. When writing interactions in your story

I hope you enjoyed it, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yannbf). If you want to know more about the potential of Storybook and how to use it effectively in React projects, I created a [course](https://www.newline.co/courses/storybook-for-react-apps) that goes from the basics to complex features, with lots of pro tips in between!
