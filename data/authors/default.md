Hey! It's me, Yann Braga.

I have been working with development since 2013. Started out as a .NET developer but my passion really
sparked when I got into frontend. It became even bigger when I found out about open souce.

_Do what you love and end up helping people?_ That'd be super awesome.

Turns out I hit the jackpot and now I work at [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) maintaining [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) full time with an incredible team.

I love working with communities and sharing knowledge. This website is my space to share whatever random stuff I come up with. Welcome!
